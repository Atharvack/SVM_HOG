# Handwritten Equation Recognition using HOG \& SVM

This repository contains a project for recognizing handwritten numerical equations by first segmenting images into meaningful regions (i.e., individual characters) and then classifying them using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for feature extraction and a Polynomial Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

The project was developed as part of an ESE 590 Practical ML and AI course by Atharva Kulkarni and Anurag Chaturvedi. The approach leverages the efficiency of HOG descriptors and the robustness of SVM to achieve accurate image segmentation and classification.

## Introduction

Handwritten equation recognition poses challenges in dealing with varied handwriting styles and segmentation of dense, grid-like characters. This project tackles these challenges by:

- **Segmenting** full equation images into individual characters.
- **Extracting** HOG features to capture shape and edge details.
- **Classifying** each segmented letter using a polynomial SVM to determine the correct numerical value.

The switch from traditional SIFT to HOG was driven by the need for a fixed-length, efficient descriptor that aligns with the smoothly varying structure of handwritten characters.

---

## Project Overview

The project workflow involves:

- Preprocessing input images (resizing, noise removal).
- Applying adaptive thresholding, contour detection, and morphological operations for robust segmentation.
- Extracting fixed-length feature vectors using HOG.
- Classifying the features with a polynomial SVM.

A modular implementation in PyTorch enables running the model on both CPU and GPU, and it can be easily extended for real-time recognition tasks.

---

## Features

- **Efficient Image Segmentation:** Uses adaptive thresholding and morphological operations to isolate individual characters.
- **HOG Feature Extraction:** Captures essential shape and edge information in a fixed-length feature vector.
- **Polynomial SVM Classifier:** Balances complexity and computational efficiency by leveraging a polynomial kernel.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Easily adjust HOG and SVM parameters to optimize performance.

Below is a comparison of different HOG configurations explored during development:


| Configuration | Orientations | Pixels per Cell | Cells per Block | Performance |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Best Configuration** | 12 | 4 x 4 | 3 x 3 | Optimal performance |
| **Generalized Approach** | 9 | 8 x 8 | 2 x 2 | Underperformed |
| **Overfitting Setup** | 16 | 4 x 4 | 3 x 3 | Overfitting observed |

---

## Methodology

### Data Processing

- **Preprocessing:**
Uniformly resize images and remove noise using morphological operations to enhance segmentation results.
- **Class Balancing:**
Data augmentation techniques ensure that the classifier receives a balanced view of each character category.


### HOG Feature Extraction

- **Gradient Computation:**
Computes gradients for each pixel to capture edge directions.
- **Cell and Block Processing:**
Divides the image into cells, computes local histograms, normalizes over blocks, and flattens into a feature vector.


### SVM Classification

- **Support Vector Machines:**
Utilizes a polynomial kernel SVM to project data into higher dimensions, making it linearly separable.
- **Margin Optimization:**
The classifier maximizes the margin between class boundaries while handling misclassified instances using custom hinge loss.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-equation-recognition.git
cd handwritten-equation-recognition
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed. Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Dependencies include:*
    - PyTorch
    - scikit-image
    - NumPy
    - pickle (standard library)

---

## Usage

Run the main testing script to load pre-trained features and the SVM model and test on images:

```bash
python main.py
```

For example, the script will process the input image, extract HOG features, and output the predicted class for each segmented character. The process includes:

- Loading saved training parameters and classes.
- Running an image through adaptive segmentation.
- Extracting the feature vector and classifying with the trained SVM model.
